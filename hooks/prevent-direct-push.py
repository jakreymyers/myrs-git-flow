Situation: You're pushing to a protected branch ({current_branch})

  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  git push origin feature/your-feature-name

Then create a PR for review.

**What you tried**: `{command}`
**Current branch**: {current_branch}
**Problem**: Direct pushes to main/develop are blocked by Git Flow policy

**Solution**: Use Git Flow branches instead:

1. **For features**:
   - Create: `/myrs-git-flow:feature <name>` or `git checkout -b feature/<name>`
   - Push: `git push origin feature/<name>`

2. **For releases**:
   - Create: `/myrs-git-flow:release <version>` or `git checkout -b release/v<version>`
   - Push: `git push origin release/v<version>`

3. **For hotfixes**:
   - Create: `/myrs-git-flow:hotfix <name>` or `git checkout -b hotfix/<name>`
   - Push: `git push origin hotfix/<name>`

**Why this matters**: Protected branches require pull requests for code review, CI checks, and team visibility.

üí° **Quick fix**: `git checkout -b feature/<descriptive-name>` then `git push origin feature/<descriptive-name>`"""
